<strong>Here are some awesome facts about me: üóíÔ∏è</strong>

  * I am an <strong>iOS</strong>, <strong>macOS</strong> and <strong>VisionOS</strong> developer, mostly anything related to apple devices.
  * I am currently studying VisionOS ecosystem more deeply, focusing at <strong>manupulating entities in the virtual reality world</strong>.
  * I also love (with all my heart) web development, specially <strong>front-end</strong> which I can work using <strong>React, Tailwind, CSS and other libraries.</strong>
  * I enjoy learn and develop back-end applications either and I can absolutely work with NodeJS, Sequelize, MySQL and Postgres.
